# [Sinatra_Mobile][repo], The easiest way to get [jQuery Mobile][jqm] inside your Sinatra app.

## Features:

- You'll get and running jQuery Mobile in a minute! We include examples!
- We're using the latest jQuery Mobile version, and we'll update it as they release a new version.
- All "Apple app mode" goodies enabled by default. Including "Add to home screen", fullscreen, iPod/iPad/iPhone icons, splash screens, authomatic viewports...
- We replace the ugly jQuery Mobile css, and trasnsformed it into a nice compass (sass) code. Easy, beatiful and easy to modify.

## Installation

** Latest version is: 0.0.1 **

### Using RubyGems

_This is the recommended way._

```sh
    gem install sinatra_mobile;
```

Add this line inside your Sinatra app:
```ruby
    require 'sinatra_mobile'
```

And that's it!.

Over the time, I worked (and learned) from this guys:

- [jQuery Mobile][jqm] team, they're the best!.
- [CrowdInteractive][crowdint] team, best place to work.

Thank you!
